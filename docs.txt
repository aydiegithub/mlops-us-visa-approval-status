## problem statement
# USA visa approval status
- given certain set of features such as continent, education, job-experience, training, employment, current age, etc.
- we have to predict the probability of a visa approval.



# tools and tech
- Python, MongoDB, Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn



# Solution scope
- This can be used on real life by US visa applicants so that they can improve their resume and criteria to get visa approved.



# Solution Approach
- Machine Learning (classification algorithms)



# Solution Proposed
- Load the data from MongoDB
- Perform EDA and feature engineering to select the desirable features
- Fit the ML classification algorithm and find out the best model
- Select top few and tune the hyperparameters
- Select the best model based on desired metrics



# Project Setup
- GitHub Repository
- Requirements
- Template



# Resources:
- MLOps tool: https://www.evidentlyai.com/
- MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/


Step 2
# Setup Database
# Logging Module
# Exception Module
# Utility Module

# From keggle to MongoDB connect it
    - Do data ingestion on DB

# Create the MDB Account
